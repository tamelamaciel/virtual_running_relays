*West End Runners in Leicester challenge local clubs to a virtual running relay*

During the lock-down, club runners are missing the buzz and companionship of races. But we can still compete virtually!

35 runners per club, 30 minute slots run from anywhere, how far in total can each club go? 
Most cummulative mileage wins.

This notebook digs into the stats of two recent races:  
* 2 May: West End Runners (WER) vs Wigston Phoenix (WP)  
* 9 May: West End Runners (WER) vs Wellingborough & District Athletic Club (WDAC)  

Various statistical plots are created, along with a heat map of routes, drawn from gpx files.
